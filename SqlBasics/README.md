# SQL Basics

A single screen app that simply instantiates a Room database. Rather than interacting with the
database through Kotlin code, you'll learn the fundamentals of SQL, including writing queries to get
data, as well as how to insert and delete from a database.

When the app is running, you'll be able to send SQL commands to the database via Android Studio's
Database Inspector.
